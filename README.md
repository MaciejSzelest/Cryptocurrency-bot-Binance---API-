Hello, 

I would like to present you my first cryptocurrency bot, with the use of websocket price information and indicators from ta-lib module. Everything is linked to Binance cryptocurrency exchange.

If you would like to use it, please remember to open your Binance account and create your own Api key.

At the beginning project is based on simple RSI indicator, there is ongoing development work, so it might change in the future. Python module used:
websocket, 
json, 
pprint, 
numpy, 
talib,
binance.client,
binance.enums.

Remember, you use it at your own risk! Do not invest money which you can't afford to lose.
